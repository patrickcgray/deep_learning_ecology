    "Technical and engineering tutorials for your favourite language or library are easy to find, but if you're interested in some of the more conceptual and mathematical background, take a look at:\n",
    " - Michael Nielsen's online textbook \"[Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/)\" (especially chapters 1, 2 and 3)\n",
    " - Weeks 4 and 5 of Andrew Ng's Coursera course \"[Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)\" (you'll have to sign up for the course to access these materials)\n",
    " - \"[Deep Learning](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v521/n7553/abs/nature14539.html)\" by Yan Le Cun et al. in Nature (2015) (you can find a [PDF of this article on Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5362332738201102290))\n",
    " - Chris Olah's [wonderful essays](http://colah.github.io/), particularly the ones on [back propagation](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Backprop/) (the algorithm with which neural networks are trained) and [recurrent neural networks](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/).\n",

    "Speaking of recurrent neural networks, Keras also has layers that allow you to build models with:\n",
    "\n",
    " - convolutional layers, which give state-of-the-art results for computer vsion problems;\n",
    " - recurrent layers, which are particularly well suited to modelling language and other sequence data.\n",
    " \n",
    "In fact, one key strength of neural networks (along with sheer predictive power) is their composability. Using a high-level library like Keras, it takes only a few seconds of work to create a very different network. Models can be built up like Lego. Have fun!"
